# Feature-Engineering
Why we need to Feature Engineering?
All machine learning algorithms use some input data to create outputs. This input data comprise features, which are usually in the form of structured columns. Algorithms require features with some specific characteristic to work properly. Here, the need for feature engineering arises.
